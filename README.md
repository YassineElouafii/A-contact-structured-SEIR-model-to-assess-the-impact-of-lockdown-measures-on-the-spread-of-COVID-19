# A-contact-structured-SEIR-model-to-assess-the-impact-of-lockdown-measures-on-the-spread-of-COVID-19

Pandemic Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is the new threat to public health. In the absence of an effective vaccine, many
countries are forced to resort to non-pharmaceutical interventions to try to control the spread of this virus. Strategies used include
school closures and social distancing, population containment, and disinfection of public places. In order to model the impact of these
interventions, we used the SEIR (Sensible Exposed Infected Recovered) model structured by contact matrices and age structure, which
also allowed us to model different strategies that Morocco can adopt. The model takes into account the dynamics of interactions
between different age sections and in different locations. After validating the model using the available data, we simulated three
strategies or scenarios, compared and analyzed their results and finally chose the best strategy to adopt.
